I recognize myself as a Full Stack Developer, Freelancer, DevOps Engineer, a Tech Enthusiast and a novice blogger trying to develop and maintain hobbies that complement my skills ðŸŽ‰

![Developing code, learning stuff and writing about it on my blog.](/media/image-2.jpg)

*I discovered my passion for code when I was a sophomore in High School.*

It was then when it became clear what I wanted to do for a living.\
I pursued my career learning the Java and JS stack. Started my journey of becoming a web developer and along the way realized my love for markets like Blockchain and ML.

While working on professional and hobby projects developed a knack for DevOps and have been diving ever so deeper learning new things each passing day.
