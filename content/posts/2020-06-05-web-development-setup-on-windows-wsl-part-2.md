Now that we've already setup the basic Ubuntu terminal on WSL it looks, well, pretty darn unpleasant. There are a couple of things which look pretty out of place the most obvious ones are the default fonts and the directory colors, yuk!

So let's start customizing it to make it look as sleek as possible.

## Installing Oh My Zsh!

Well most of you must be familiar with the Z shell already. If you haven't heard about it this is a shell replacement for bash which comes with handy plugins to ease our most common workflows, custom aliases and pretty themes.
