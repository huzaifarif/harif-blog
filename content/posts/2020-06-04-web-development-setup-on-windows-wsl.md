Linux has been the go to for web developers for as long as I can remember. I still prefer using a Linux machine for development specifically, but there are things that are just better in Windows. The most important one: **Games** ðŸŽ®

# What is WSL?

WSL stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux. This is a completely new take on how to run Linux alongside Windows. We all have been running VMs on Windows or dual booting our systems to achieve this. But both of the above have there cons, for instance:

* VMs are resource heavy and don't give the same performance as a native installation, especially noticeable on the more common consumer grade hardware.
* Dual booting on the other hand doesn't allow you to run both at the same time. Also poses challenges when trying to access files of one OS from the other, let alone using programs installed across them.

Well, WSL aims at solving both the above problems and a bit more

> The Windows Subsystem for Linux lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a virtual machine

You can read more about it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

## How can I get it?

#### Prerequisites:

Well WSL is available on all editions of Windows since the Fall Creators Update. WSL2 is available on all editions starting the May 2020 update (if you haven't received it yet head to [Update Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) to grab it).

#### How to enable it:

1. PowerShell:

   * Press `âŠž Win` + `X` and choose **Windows PowerShell (Admin)** to open a PowerShell window with elevated rights.
   * Type/Paste the following command:

     ```
     Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
     ```
2. Control Panel:

   * Press `âŠž Win` to open start menu.
   * Type **Turn Windows features on or off**

     ![Search and choose "Turn Windows features on or off"](/media/wsl-start-menu.png)
   * In the window that opens scroll down and select the item **Windows Subsystem for Linux**

     ![Select check box next to Windows Subsystem for Linux](/media/wsl-turn-on-feature.png)

   And that's it, you have enabled WSL ðŸŽ‰

#### Linux means Distros right?

Well, yeah! Now that we have enabled WSL lets head on to the Microsoft Store to grab one of the available distributions. Yes you heard that right. We'll be downloading Linux distribution just like any other app from the Microsoft Store!
